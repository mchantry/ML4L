    "# Neural Network mapping to learn MODIS LST from ERA features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `X data`. This is the ERA `.grib` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Y data`. This is the MODIS `.tif` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert The ERA `.grib` files \n",
    "\n",
    "   These are are on a monthly grain and quite large. It is useful to convert these into `NetCDF` files on a hourly grain. This makes IO and operations on these files much faster. This is done in`convert_grib_to_netcdf.py`. See also `01.Convert_grib_to_NetCDF.ipynb`. In this step we also convert the longtiude to `long1` format so as to match the format in the MODIS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Join the ERA and MODIS data\n",
    "\n",
    "   These are joined in both time/space to produce a collection of hourly `.pkl` files. This is done in `join_MODIS_with_ERA.py`. See also `02.Join_MODIS_with_ERA_NetCDF.ipynb`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Create a single ML dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "    We then join all these hourly files into a single `ML_data.pkl` which can be easily loaded. This is currently done in `15.Sequential_NN_more_features`\n",

    "### Further information \n",
    "We have 4 “types” of ERA file, corresponding to different model fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. `sfc_skin_unstructured_...`. 10 years of data (2010-2020), hourly grain\n",
    "\n",
    "        aluvp, aluvd, alnip, alnid, cl, cvl, mvh, istl1, istl2, slt, sdfor, z, sd, store, isor, anor, spor, 2d, lsm, fal\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. `sfc_unstructured_...` 3 years of data (2018,209,2020), hourly grain\n",
    "\n",
    "        sp, msl, 10u, 10v, 2t\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. `sfc_skin2_unstructured_...` 10 years of data, only at 06:00 and 18:00\n",

    "        ssrd, strd, tp\n",

    "    4. `ml_skin_unstructured...` 10 years of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "        some spherical harmonic fields\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "We will use exclusively `sfc_unstructured_` and `sfc_skin_unstructured_` for 2018-2020\n",
